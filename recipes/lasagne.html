    <h1>Lasagne</h1>



<img src="../images/lasagne.jpeg"

<p>Lasagna (plural “lasagne”) is a flat and expanded pasta sheet, traditionally made in Italy with Parmigiano-Reggiano (Parmesan cheese), Béchamel sauce (white sauce), and ragù (a meat-based sauce). Despite the traditional form still being popular, lasagna has taken on many different recipes over the years. The dish is made by stacking lasagna sheets on top of each other with meats, vegetables, cheeses, and tomato sauce between. It is then baked before being served.</p>

<h4><strong>Ingredients List</strong></h4>

<li>1 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
<li>1 Onion Diced</li>
<li>1 Carrot Diced</li>
<li>1 Celery Stalk Diced</li>
<li>2 Garlic Cloves Diced</li>
<li>250g Beef Mince</li>
<li>250g Pork Mince</li>
<li>1 Tbsp Tomato Puree</li>
<li>400g Tin Chopped Tomatoes</li>
<li>200ml Beef Stalk</li>
<li>200ml Red Wine</li>
<li>1 Tbsp Worcestershire Sauce</li>
<li>9-12 Lasagna Sheets</li>
<li>50 g Parmesan - Grated</li>
<li>150g Pack Mozzarella Cheese - Shredded</li>

<h4><strong>Steps</strong></h4>

<ol>
    <li>In a large pan, heat the olive oil over a low heat. Fry the onion, carrot, celery and garlic for 5 mins, or until softened. Add the mince and fry on a medium heat until golden. Turn up the heat, pour in the wine and bubble until reduced. Stir in the tomato purée, chopped tomatoes and stock. Add in the Worcestershire sauce and simmer for 15 mins, or until the liquid has reduced. Season.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, make the white sauce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan over a low heat and add the flour. Whisk until combined and cook on low for 1-2 mins. Remove from the heat and gradually whisk in the milk until you have a loose sauce. Season. Return to a gentle heat and whisk constantly until the sauce thickens.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Layer up the lasagne in a baking dish, starting with a third each of the ragu, then the pasta, then the white sauce. Repeat twice. Top with the Parmesan and mozzarella then bake in the oven for 40-45 mins, until piping hot and crisp and bubbling on top. Serve immediately.</li>
