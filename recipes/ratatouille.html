    <p>Rattouille is a stew of zucchini, peppers,tomatoes and eggplant, with herbs and spices and some onions and garlic usually thrown in for good measure</p>

    <p>The modern recipe for Ratatouille originated in the Nice and Provencal regions of France. Its official French name is Ratatouille Niçoise.</p>

   <h4>Ingredients List</h4>

    <li>2 Large Aubergines</li>
    <li>4 Small Courgettes</li>
    <li>2 Red or Yellow Peppers</li>
    <li>4 Large Ripe Tomatoes</li>
    <li>5 Tbsp Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Small Bunch Basil</li>
    <li>1 Medium Onion Thinly Sliced</li>
    <li>3 Garlic Cloves Peeled and Crushed</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp Red Wine Vinegar</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp Sugar (Any Kind)</li>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven for 375˚F (190˚C)</li>
        <li>Using a sharp knife or a mandoline, slice the eggplant, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini into approximately ¹⁄₁₆-inch (1-mm)-thick rounds, then set aside</li>
        <li>Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch (30-cm) oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion, garlic, and bell peppers until soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add the crushed tomatoes. Stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Remove from heat, then add the basil. Stir once more, then smooth the surface of the sauce with a spatula</li>
        <li>Arrange the veggies in alternating slices, (for example, eggplant, tomato, squash, zucchini) on top of the sauce, working from the outer edge to the center of the pan. Season with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Make the herb seasoning: In a small bowl, mix together the basil, garlic, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Spoon the herb seasoning over the vegetables</li>
        <li>Cover the pan with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover, then bake for another 20 minutes, until the vegetables are softened</li>
        <li>Serve hot as a main dish or side. The ratatouille is also excellent the next day–cover with foil and reheat in a 350˚F (180˚C) oven for 15 minutes, or simply microwave to desired temperature</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
